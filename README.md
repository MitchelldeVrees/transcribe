## Environment configuration

Create a `.env.local` file for development and `.env.production` for your
production deployment. With NextAuth you'll need at least the following keys:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=complex_random
BACKEND_JWT_SECRET=another_secret
```

Use your real production keys in the production file. Next.js will load the
appropriate file based on `NODE_ENV`.
